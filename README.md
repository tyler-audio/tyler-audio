Hey, I'm Tyler!

I am a full stack software developer and audio engineer currently residing in Temecula, California. As an imaginative and creative individual, you will find me spending most of my time either recording music, reading a novel, or coding a new passion project. I love being introduced to new music or books so throw your recommendations my way!

If you have any questions or would simply like to connect, don't hesitate to reach out!
