## Hey, I'm Tyler! ðŸ‘‹

I am a full stack software developer and audio engineer currently residing in Temecula, California. As an imaginative and creative individual, you will find me spending most of my time either coding a new passion project, recording music, or reading a novel. I love being introduced to new music or books so throw your recommendations my way!

#### If you have any questions or would simply like to connect, don't hesitate to reach out!
